# Connect-Four-1.0
Finished the basic Java course from programmieren-starten.de

Fourth real practice project to consolidate what I've learned there.
A very basic console application of the game Connect 4. Humble beginnings...

Update May 28th 2022, finished the project. Learned writing algorithms that
scan a 2d array for specified conditions, in this case the "Connect Four"
win condition. Also learned about a simple way to scan for a draw condition,
just a simple integer counter that scans if all fields are occupied and then
triggers the draw condition if no win condition is triggered at the last possible
turn. Also made strides to utilize OOP more than I did in my previous projects,
I need to learn how to think with portals.... ehhhh sry objects, I mean objects.
Next will be my very own random number generator using as little pre-programmed
code as possible. If that won't work I'll do my chess game to finish this part of
my training and move one to JavaFX or some Web-Dev stuff to round up my beginner
toolset.
